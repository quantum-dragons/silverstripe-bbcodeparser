SilverStripe BBCode Parser for SilverStripe 4
==========================

**This module is no longer supported**

This module provides the SS3.x BBCode Parser for modules that rely on it. It has been decoupled from the SS4 framework.

We recommend that you update your code to make use of another BBCode parsing library.
